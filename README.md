Azure Cloud Network: Here, you will find a collection of MacOS, Linux, and Ansible scripts used for the Cyber Security Boot Camp. Scripts are used for the following: -Configure and manage Azure virtual machines -Create and deploy Docker containers -Deploy Ansible playbooks to manage virtual machines -Launch ELK Stack The final setup includes a jumpbox hosting ansible container which connects to three seperate virtual machines.There are two machines (for redundancy) hosting DVWA and one server hosting ELK Stack.The above set up is protected by a firewall configured with a whitelist and secured ports.

Automated ELK Stack Deployment

The files in this repository were used to configure the network depicted below.

These files have been tested and used to generate a live ELK deployment on Azure. They can be used to either recreate the entire deployment pictured above. Alternatively, select portions of the .yml file may be used to install only certain pieces of it, such as Filebeat.

Description of the Topology

The main purpose of this network is to expose a load-balanced and monitored instance of DVWA, the D*mn Vulnerable Web Application.

Load balancing ensures that the application will be highly available, in addition to restricting inbound access to the network.

The load balancer aids in security by offloading traffic from a corporate server to a public cloud provider. Integrating an ELK (Elasticsearch, Logstash, and Kibana) server allows users to easily monitor the vulnerable VMs for changes to the file names and watch system metrics.
Filebeat monitors the logs in the specified locations. It detects changes to the filesystem. It collects logs and forwards them to Elastisearch or Logstash for indexing

Metricbeat detects changes in system metrics such as CPU usage. We use it to detect SSH login attempts

The configuration details of each machine may be found below.

Name	Function	IP Address	Operating System
Jump Box	Gateway	10.0.0.4	Linux
Web-1	Server	10.0.0.5	Linux
Web-2	Server	10.0.0.6	Linux
Web-3	Server	10.0.0.7	Linux
ELK Server	Monitoring	10.1.0.4	Linux

Access Policies
The machines on the internal network are not exposed to the public Internet.

Only the Jumpbox Provisioner machine can accept connections from the Internet. Access to this machine is only allowed from the designated public IP address. This address changes each time the machine is powered down and restarted.

Machines within the network can only be accessed by peer servers. The Jumpbox Provisioner connects via SSH to the Webservers (Web 1, Web 2 & Web 3) and the ELK Server. The Web Server machines send logs to the ELK Server to be forwarded for indexing.

A summary of the access policies in place can be found in the table below.

Jump Box	Yes	10.0.0.1-254
Web-1	No	10.0.0.1-254
Web-2	No	10.0.0.1-254
Web-3	No	10.0.0.1-254
ELK Server	No	10.1.0.0-254

Elk Configuration
Ansible was used to automate configuration of the ELK Server. No configuration was performed manually, which is advantageous because...

Using Ansible allowed me to quickly install, update, and add the web servers to the network using the same playbooks
The playbook implements the following tasks:

Install docker on all network machines so they will be able to recieve and install containers
Ansible is installed on the Jump Box VM to distribute containers to other VMs on the network
Ansible playbooks are used to install the ELK stack container on the ELK server and a 'Beats' containers on the Web servers
The following screenshot displays the result of running docker ps after successfully configuring the ELK instance.



Target Machines & Beats This ELK server is configured to monitor the following machines:

10.0.0.5 10.0.0.6 10.0.0.7

We have installed the following Beat on these machines:

filebeat-7.6.1-amd64.deb This Beat allow us to collect the following information from each machine:

Filebeat is used to send your log files to kibana. Filebeat monitors and collects log events on specificed servers.

We have installed the following Beats on these machines:

Filebeat
Metricbeat
These Beats allow us to collect the following information from each machine:

Filebeat - Filebeat detects changes to the filesystem. We are using this to monitor our Web Log data.
Metricbeat - Metricbeat detects changes in system metrics, such as CPU usage. We use it to detect SSH login attempts, failed sudo escalations, and CPU/RAM statistics.
The Ansible Playbooks used can be found here

ansible-playbook elk-playbook.yml

ansible-playbook filebeat-playbook.yml

Ansible-playbook metricbeat-playbook.yml

Using the Playbook In order to use the playbook, you will need to have an Ansible control node already configured. Assuming you have such a control node provisioned:
SSH into the control node and follow the steps below:

Copy the .yml files to /etc/ansible directory.

Update the hosts file to be as follows. This will assign the VM servers to their server groups for the Ansible Playbooks.

   [webservers]
    10.0.0.5
    10.0.0.6
    10.0.0.7
   [elkservers]
    10.1.0.4
    
Run the playbook, and navigate to Kibana to check that the installation worked as expected.

cd /etc/ansible
ansible-playbook elk-playbook.yml
ansible-playbook filebeat-playbook.yml
Ansible-playbook metricbeat-playbook.yml

Then navigate to curl http://184.145.107.194/app/kibana#/home (Kibana) to check that the installation worked as expected.
